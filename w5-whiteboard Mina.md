as conversational as possible, more the way you communicate


SUMMER:

- what's your dream job?
- modular operator 
performed on two numbers 
- how is a symbol, different from a variable

symbol is created in a class, outside in a class.
I can't change a symbol, I can change a variable at anytime
String VS symbol
strings 'cat' symbol

symbol is stored in memory.

PROMPT :

array of numbers
write a function
returns array 
remove all the duplicates
array stored from least to greatest

?input example and output
input   [1,1,2,3,4,5,5]
output: [1,2,3,4,5]

language? JS

example of iteration logic
suggestions : pseudocode more to make sure everything is in place before you 
.contains ?
equivalent of the function in another language





array of 3 numbers
function return wheter or not the sum of the three numers 
return sum of 3 numbers is less than 20

 numbers = [ 5, 8, 2]

 <!-- define a function  -->
 <!-- define var = sum of 3 numbers array -->
 <!-- if statement  -->
     <!-- compare new variable = 20
     return
     boolean  (true or false) -->


     const numQuest = (array) => {
       let sumofNum = array.sum()
       return (sumoofNum < 20 )
     }

     console.log (numQuest(numers))

     feedback:


     good answer, 
     pseudocode: using save the file
     more conversational
     make sure you don't stop
